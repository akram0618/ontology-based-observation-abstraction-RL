# Controller
The controlling process is determined as in every timestep the optimal temperature range is provided and the controller's task is to determine the right heating power.

## PID
PID controller is so widely used, which makes it perfect for a reasonable baseline.

The controller has a target value, which is the required temperature in the predefined future

## RL
The RL folder collect the Reinforcement Learning based controlling solutions such as:
* DDPG
* PPO
* SAC
